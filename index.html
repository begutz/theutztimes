        <h2>Begum is learning HTML and CSS with Frontend Masters!</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks to newly added free lessons in Frontend Masters, I started
          refreshing my knowledge on HTML and CSS. Really enjoying the Brian
          Holt's lectures so far! I think I'm finally getting how flexbox works.
          I will definitely take more advanced courses in CSS to get better at
          it. I think CSS is so much fun!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now looking forward to the Javascript lessons. Hopefully there
          will be another fun project awaiting at the end of the class.

          BREAKING NEWS: Chicken sandwich treats are the suspected culprit of
          tummy aches in Amy the beagle
        </h2>
        <img
          class="amy-image"

          alt="Amy the beagle smiling at the camera"
        />
        <p>
          You might think that it was the peanuts or cottage cheese which caused
          the beagle's upset stomach. But most recent studies show that the
          beagle most likely got the runs due to the "chicken sandwich treats"
          that Michael bought.
        </p>
        <p>
          After eating copious amounts of grass, Amy was able to feel better and
          continue her daily program of taking naps, growling at neighbor's dogs
          and expecting pets from family members. Now the question is, are we
          still going to feed her the chicken sandwich treats?

        <h2>Crazy rains in Helsinki on July 16, 2019!</h2>
        <p>
          There was some crazy rain along with strong winds in Vuosaari this
          afternoon. Residents from the Utz family stayed indoors to stay dry.
          Later in the day, rain stopped and Amy was able to go outside and
          sniff for bunnies.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, summer in Helsinki has been amazing. Most days have been sunny
          but not scorching hot. Days are VERY long, with sunset at 22:30.

        <h2>Michael continues keto diet, while Begum bails</h2>
        <p>
          You may know that Michael and Begum had started the "Keto diet"
          earlier this summer. After couple of weeks of trying to eat keto,
          Begum decided to quit. Although, dinners with no-carb tacos and cheesy
          breads were fun, not eating fruits was difficult. However, Michael is
          still on it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Begum is now back to good-old calorie counting.
